Learning Resource Tracker

The Learning Tracker website is typically designed to help users monitor their learning progress, set goals, and reflect on achievements. Hereâ€™s a general breakdown of its main features and sections:

1. Dashboard: The homepage or main area where users can see an overview of their learning goals, recent activities, and progress across various subjects or skills.

2. Goal Setting: A section where users can set specific learning goals, like completing certain courses, mastering a skill, or reaching a particular competency level. These goals can often be broken down into smaller milestones to track progress over time.

3. Learning Modules and Resources: A repository for courses, articles, videos, or other learning materials, organized by topic or skill area. Users can browse these resources and bookmark or add them to their learning path.

4. Progress Tracking: This feature provides a detailed view of the user's learning journey, showing progress bars, percentages, or completed milestones. It may also include visual graphs or timelines to illustrate progress over time.
